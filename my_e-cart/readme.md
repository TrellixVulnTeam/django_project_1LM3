# My E-cart
This Project is based on django in which i have created a e-commerce website having paytm integration for transactions.
This website also has a blog in it which is fully dynamic in nature.
<br>
This is helpful in learning the basics concept of django which are implemented in this.
<br>
A personw ho is willing to start a e-cart can take this as a starting and could deploy products over this and could sell things online.<br>
One of the best things about this is paytm integration which provides various different transaction options available in this.<br>
Also if you want to keep users updated about the things you also have a blog in this and blogs can be added from the backend which are available for the users to read<br>
