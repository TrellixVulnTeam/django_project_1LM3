when we are paying with the help of paytm then if we go back or refreh the page we see the order failure but in reality the order gets placed.
We get a order id for that and the order can be traced using that order id
This can be corrected by filling the order details as it is done noe and adding a field saying incomplete as a default value and which changes to complete once the transaction is complete.
